These are my notes and files for the SANS Holiday Hack 2020 Challenge.

I had built it around a website, and yet ran out of time to fully polish it as much as I would like.

I definitely want to thanks Ed Skoudis, the Counter Hack team, and everyone else who participated to make this happen.  It truly was a great experience!
