00:03
cringlecon 3 french hens my name is dave
00:06
harold i'm a principal security
00:08
strategist
00:08
at splunk and we're very happy to be
00:12
here today at kringlecon to talk to you
00:14
about adversary emulation and automation
00:18
a bit about my background i've been in
00:21
security and technology
00:23
for quite a long time now i've had many
00:26
different
00:26
security roles everything from running
00:29
security programs as an information
00:31
security officer to being a security
00:33
architect security engineer
00:35
security analyst and i've had lots of
00:38
roles in it
00:39
as well mostly around infrastructure
00:42
system administration and network
00:44
engineering
00:45
i'm a former sans mentor and i've
00:49
really been a product of sans in my
00:52
career
00:52
i'm a gse a lot of sand certifications
00:55
i've spoken at a number of
00:57
sans summits over the past few years
00:59
with my colleague ryan kovar
01:02
currently in security i'm focusing on
01:04
adversary emulation which is the subject
01:06
of this talk
01:08
cloud security and i've been doing a lot
01:10
of full stack development
01:12
and getting into devsecops more in
01:16
in my in my day job at splunk i've been
01:18
at splunk for about six years
01:20
and i'm the co-creator of the splunk
01:22
boss of the sock
01:25
as i said we're very appreciative of the
01:28
opportunity to be able
01:29
to participate in kringlecon and in
01:32
holiday hack challenge
01:35
there's a great deal of trust that's
01:36
been placed in us by sans and by ed and
01:39
by
01:39
the folks at counter hack and we take
01:42
that very seriously
01:44
at every turn we will seek to emphasize
01:47
security and best practices and we will
01:50
not emphasize product positioning
01:53
in these challenges with that said
01:59
we do use splunk in these challenges and
02:02
it's because that's what we have access
02:03
to
02:04
but most of these concepts are universal
02:07
and could be applied to
02:09
really any technology stack that you
02:12
have in your sock
02:13
so please keep that in mind as we
02:15
proceed
02:17
why should we emulate the adversary well
02:20
number one it allows us to build better
02:23
detections
02:24
one of the primary activities that you
02:26
engage in
02:27
as a blue teamer protecting an
02:29
organization is to create detections
02:31
that can raise alerts when evidence of
02:35
adversary activity is detected
02:38
in order to do that and in order to
02:40
improve those detections over time you
02:42
need a source
02:43
of telemetry a source of data that
02:46
represents the adversary's activities
02:49
a great way to get that is through
02:50
emulation while it's certainly not the
02:53
only way to get that data
02:54
it does offer some benefits especially
02:57
consistency
02:58
and repeatability
03:02
the next reason is that emulation allows
03:05
you to test your detections
03:07
security detections are actually quite
03:09
fragile they're subject to
03:11
many externalities that can cause them
03:14
to stop working
03:15
the most successful organizations treat
03:18
their detections
03:19
like code and they test them with a ci
03:22
cd pipeline
03:24
in order to do that you need
03:25
repeatability you need consistency
03:28
and adversary emulation offers that
03:32
the third reason is that it allows you
03:35
to test your vendors
03:36
claims about their products every
03:39
security team has dozens
03:40
if not hundreds of different tools in
03:43
their sock tool chain
03:45
each one of those tools claims to
03:48
provide certain value to your
03:50
organization but it becomes very very
03:53
useful to be able to emulate adversary
03:56
activity in a realistic way
03:58
and then test whether those solutions
04:00
can actually
04:02
detect that activity we
04:05
have seen a dramatic increase over the
04:07
last year to 18 months
04:10
of customers demanding that
04:13
we emulate the adversary and then show
04:16
that our products can detect that
04:18
it's an extremely effective tactic to
04:21
use
04:21
when dealing with vendors or when
04:23
testing
04:24
one vendor solution versus another
04:29
if you'd like to dig a little bit deeper
04:31
into reasons
04:32
why you should include adversary
04:34
simulation in your security program
04:37
you might want to check out some of
04:38
these resources
04:40
over the past couple years some
04:41
colleagues of mine and i
04:43
have been working on an adversary
04:46
simulation project
04:48
and we've presented on that at a number
04:49
of conferences
04:51
some splunk user conferences a sans
04:54
blue team summit and also black hat
04:56
arsenal
04:57
both usa and asia in 2020 i do recommend
05:01
checking these out
05:02
they give a little deeper treatment to
05:04
why you might want to do adversary
05:05
simulation
05:06
but for today we're going to continue on
05:09
and show you
05:09
exactly how to start simulating the
05:12
adversary
05:15
so i want to show you one way that you
05:17
can get started with adversary emulation
05:20
it's really broken down into four easy
05:22
components or steps
05:24
the first one is splunk attack range
05:27
second is the miter attack framework
05:29
third is the atomic red team project
05:32
from red canary
05:33
and fourth is splunk
05:38
splunk attack range number one on this
05:40
list is a really cool project
05:42
it's free it's open source it's created
05:46
by some really smart people at splunk
05:48
and it makes it really easy to spin up a
05:51
range
05:52
and then to launch attacks in that range
05:56
and then look at the results in splunk
06:00
the miter attack framework of course is
06:03
the basis of
06:04
a lot of security content these days
06:06
it's a knowledge base
06:08
of adversarial activities and it's free
06:11
to use
06:12
by published by mitre it's an amazing
06:15
resource
06:16
most security content these days has
06:19
some sort of a mapping
06:20
to the mitre attack framework
06:24
the third item on this list atomic red
06:26
team is also free
06:27
it's an open source project it's created
06:29
by
06:30
red canary amazing company who
06:33
contributes so much
06:35
to the open source community
06:39
the fourth on this list is splunk splunk
06:42
has some forms in which it is free
06:45
it's freeish certainly for everything
06:48
we're going to show you in this
06:50
talk today and anything that you'll see
06:53
at kringlecon or in the holiday hack
06:54
challenge
06:55
you can do that with the free version of
06:57
splunk
06:58
and in fact the splunk attack range item
07:01
number one
07:02
provides splunk for free it spins up a
07:05
splunk
07:06
instance running with the free license
07:09
the bottom line is you can employ
07:12
this flavor of adversary emulation for
07:15
free
07:16
now you might accumulate a bit of cloud
07:19
infrastructure as a service costs to
07:21
spin up
07:22
systems but there's no software
07:24
licensing fees
07:25
involved so let's talk about the splunk
07:29
attack range
07:31
as we mentioned on the last slide splunk
07:33
attack range is a free open source
07:35
project
07:37
you can check it out at the url listed
07:39
on the bottom of this slide
07:41
attack range is a python script and a
07:43
set of configurations for terraform
07:45
and ansible that allow you to set up
07:47
ranges
07:49
in cloud services like aws and azure
07:53
you can actually use attack range to set
07:56
up ranges locally
07:58
on systems as well however we'll only
08:00
talk about
08:01
the cloud options today
08:04
the ranges include an active directory
08:07
server
08:07
they can include windows servers they
08:10
can include windows clients
08:11
they can include linux machines the
08:14
windows systems are configured with
08:16
sysmon
08:17
they're configured with a inappropriate
08:19
logging policy for windows security
08:22
events
08:23
you can include os query you can include
08:25
caldera and atomic red team
08:27
we'll talk a lot about atomic red team
08:29
today
08:30
you can include things like splunk
08:32
stream the splunk universal forwarder
08:34
which is the agent that
08:36
sends logs from systems to splunk
08:42
you can also include miter caldera you
08:44
can include
08:45
of course splunk and splunk phantom and
08:48
even
08:49
kali linux and this is all driven by the
08:51
configuration that you choose
08:54
one thing that is of note is if you see
08:56
at the bottom of this slide where it
08:58
says
08:58
index equals win index equals attack
09:02
index equals main these are the places
09:05
within splunk
09:06
that you are going to see the events
09:08
that are generated by our adversary
09:10
emulation
09:12
it's important when you get into the
09:14
holiday hack challenge
09:15
that you pay special attention to what
09:18
index
09:18
you're searching in splunk
09:22
i'd like to call out the authors of
09:24
splunk attack range
09:26
jose hernandez and patrick berries jose
09:29
and patrick are
09:30
colleagues of mine and good friends of
09:32
mine they go to great lengths
09:34
to publish the splunk attack range to
09:37
quickly address bugs and constantly add
09:40
new features to it
09:42
they also go to a great amount of effort
09:44
to ensure that attack range
09:46
remains an open source project not an
09:48
easy thing to do at a commercial
09:50
software company
09:51
i applaud them for their efforts and i
09:54
love collaborating with these two
09:57
gentlemen and the entire
09:58
splunk threat research team let's take a
10:01
couple minutes to talk about
10:03
mitre attack miter attack is widely
10:06
covered
10:06
in information security you very likely
10:09
have heard about mitre attack and know a
10:11
lot about it already so we'll just hit
10:12
the high points
10:15
miter attack is a knowledge base of
10:16
adversary techniques
10:18
as such it's very useful to search
10:21
through the mitre attack
10:22
website when you have a question about
10:25
things like adversary simulation
10:28
that's something to keep in mind when
10:30
you are working through holiday hack
10:32
challenge
10:34
mitre attacks organized into tactics
10:37
tactics often describe
10:38
why an adversary might perpetrate a
10:41
certain type of attack
10:43
techniques are how they will perpetrate
10:46
that attack
10:47
and techniques as of fairly recently can
10:49
be divided
10:50
often into sub techniques which allows
10:53
another dimension
10:55
to more richly describe
10:58
adversary techniques
11:03
you often see mitre attack expressed as
11:06
a matrix this is the miter attack
11:08
enterprise matrix
11:10
and you can see here that the columns
11:12
are
11:13
those tactics that we mentioned on the
11:15
last slide
11:16
now under those tactics are techniques
11:19
and in fact if you click on one of these
11:21
techniques you'd see
11:23
a great deal of detail including
11:26
but not limited to these sub techniques
11:28
you can see there's 12 sub techniques
11:30
here
11:30
now this one is id 1547 or i should say
11:34
id
11:35
t 1547 t is for technique
11:38
and boot or logon auto start execution
11:42
is
11:42
a big big technique it's been used
11:46
a great deal over the years and that
11:48
really is reflected in the number of sub
11:51
techniques now also notice that this
11:54
technique
11:54
is pertinent to linux platform windows
11:58
platform
11:58
mac os platform and probably every
12:00
operating system that's ever existed
12:03
in the history of operating systems
12:06
and so you need a lot of sub techniques
12:09
to
12:10
show all the different ways that you
12:11
could attack these various different
12:13
operating systems another thing that
12:16
you'll notice here
12:17
if you look at a particular technique is
12:20
you'll find a great deal of historical
12:22
research
12:23
that's been performed so really any time
12:25
that this technique has been used
12:27
in a breach or a compromise or a
12:30
prominent attack
12:32
and there there's been public
12:34
information published about that
12:36
you'll find that reflected here there's
12:37
a great deal of threat intelligence
12:40
that goes into the miter attack and
12:42
that's one of the most
12:43
valuable parts of mitre attack is to
12:46
understand
12:47
when these techniques have been used and
12:50
to what
12:50
adversary groups these techniques have
12:52
been attributed in the past
12:56
so let's talk about item number three on
12:58
our list for
12:59
adversary emulation and that is atomic
13:02
red team
13:03
atomic red team is an open source
13:05
project it is free
13:07
it's published on github and it was
13:10
created by a company called red canary
13:12
and red canary continues to maintain
13:15
atomic red team if you're not familiar
13:17
with red canary they are
13:18
one of the most prolific contributors to
13:21
the security community that you'll ever
13:23
find
13:24
just an amazing company a really open
13:27
group of people
13:28
who are really dedicated to sort of
13:30
helping the community
13:31
they're also a commercial company you
13:33
can check out their commercial offerings
13:34
as well
13:36
but just a really big fan of red canary
13:39
let's talk about what atomic red team
13:41
brings
13:42
to us in terms of adversary emulation
13:45
so this is looking at the atomic red
13:48
team project on github
13:50
its organization mirrors the
13:52
organization of
13:54
miter attack itself in this case we're
13:56
looking at t1547
13:58
that's the same technique we looked at
14:00
earlier when we were looking at mitre
14:01
attack
14:02
but where atomic red team comes in is it
14:05
picks up
14:06
where mitre attack stops and where miter
14:09
attack will describe a certain technique
14:12
in quite a bit of detail
14:13
it stops short of giving us something
14:16
that we can
14:17
actually execute so it does not give us
14:19
source code for
14:21
a malicious program it does not give us
14:23
a command line that an attacker might
14:25
run and that's
14:26
where atomic red team comes in atomic
14:28
red team provides just
14:30
that they call them atomics and atomics
14:33
are the actual code for a particular
14:35
operating system or a particular
14:37
environment that you would run
14:38
to implement a technique and so
14:42
when we're trying to do adversary
14:43
simulation atomic red team fills a big
14:46
void it gives us a very large
14:48
library of techniques that we can
14:51
emulate
14:52
at will because we have very specific
14:55
atomic tests defined
15:00
so let's talk about our fourth and final
15:02
component of our
15:03
adversary emulation recipe that we're
15:06
creating
15:07
now recall that we're using attack range
15:09
to spin up
15:10
some target infrastructure in the cloud
15:14
we're selecting some techniques from
15:16
mitre attack
15:18
and we're instructing
15:21
attack range to run atomic tests from
15:24
atomic red team
15:25
that are aligned with our techniques
15:28
from mitre attack
15:29
and running those against that cloud
15:33
infrastructure
15:34
now the result of that will be telemetry
15:36
it will be logs
15:38
and other types of events that will be
15:40
stored in splunk
15:41
as a result of executing these
15:44
emulations
15:46
now for convenience the way we've
15:48
organized this
15:50
is that all the results from a
15:51
particular technique
15:53
are stored in their own index so you can
15:56
see here
15:57
in the splunk search window we're
15:59
specifying index
16:00
equals t1547 star
16:04
star is a wild card there's actually
16:06
multiple indexes
16:08
for some of these techniques but they
16:09
all begin with
16:11
the technique id now you'll find some
16:14
also that have a technique id followed
16:17
by a dot
16:18
and then a sub technique id and so
16:22
watch out for those as well now beyond
16:25
specifying the indexes we're showing
16:27
here you can
16:29
run all sorts of splunk search commands
16:32
any other field that you want to search
16:34
on you can simply place after that
16:36
index equals t and then the technique id
16:43
i want to show you a couple of more
16:44
important things that you'll need to
16:46
keep in mind as you're searching through
16:48
splunk one is that
16:50
you want this time picker to be set to
16:53
all time don't set it to something
16:56
shorter than that like
16:58
last 24 hours or last four hours
17:01
because this data was collected a few
17:04
weeks ago
17:06
set it to all time it's important though
17:08
to remember
17:09
that if you go back to your production
17:11
splunk instance
17:12
at your day job don't run searches for
17:15
all time
17:16
because they're typically not going to
17:18
be very performant and they typically
17:20
will consume a lot of resources and then
17:22
your splunk admin
17:23
will be upset at you and probably at me
17:27
so use all time here in the holiday hack
17:29
challenge but don't use that
17:31
when you are searching in your
17:32
production splunk instance
17:35
you should also use smart mode as
17:37
indicated here
17:38
once in a while this will get set to
17:40
something called fast mode
17:42
you typically don't want that so just
17:44
make sure that that is in
17:45
smart mode
17:50
another piece of advice that i'll give
17:52
you is to watch the
17:54
kringle con 2 video from splunk
17:58
it's called dashing through the logs
18:00
it's from 2019
18:02
it was written and presented by james
18:04
brodsky of splunk
18:06
there's loads of good recommendations in
18:08
there about how to be more effective
18:10
at searching splunk and how to traverse
18:14
through security related source types
18:18
inside splunk it's a wealth of knowledge
18:20
there
18:21
we didn't want to repeat it but if you
18:23
feel like you need a little bit more
18:24
background on how to search in splunk i
18:27
definitely recommend that you check out
18:28
this talk
18:31
and this might be the most important
18:33
slide that you want to take note of
18:36
if you're preparing for the splunk
18:38
challenge
18:39
within holiday hack challenge 2020
18:43
stay frosty
